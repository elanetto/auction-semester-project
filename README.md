This site is created for two different user experiences: A guest reader, and an account user.
The guest reader should be able to search for, find, and read blogposts. As well as copying the link to a blogpost to be able to share it with others.
The account user should be able to register, login, and then create, edit or delete blogposts.

### Main site
